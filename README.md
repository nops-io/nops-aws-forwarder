# Aws Nops Forwarder

Forward event from AWS CT into nOps

## Prerequisites
- [AWS Cloudtrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-create-a-trail-using-the-console-first-time.html) with S3 bucket for CloudTrail logs must be configured before deploying this stack.
- S3 bucket for AWS CloudTrail, and nOps-aws-forwarder should be within the some Region.
- API key from nOps, if you want to use encrypted version, please setup a symmetric encryption key within KMS in the same region of lambda and provide the permission for Lambda execution's role later.

## Installation

### CloudFormation
[![Launch Stack](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/create/review?stackName=nops-aws-forwarder&templateURL=https://nops-cloudformation-template.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/lambda-forwarder-cloudformation-template.yaml)

1. Log into your admin AWS account/role and deploy the CloudFormation Stack using the button seen above.
2. Fill in `pnOpsApiKey` or `pnOpsKmsAPIKey`, `pCTForwarderReleaseVersion`, `pCloudtrailBucketName`. All other parameters are optional.
3. Click **Create stack**, and wait for the creation to complete.
4. Find the installed forwarder Lambda function under the stack's "Resources" tab with logical ID `rLambdaForwarder`.
5. If you use KMS encrypted API key, please provide the access permission for lambda role for KMS Key
6. Repeat the steps 1-4 above in another region if you operate in multiple AWS regions with single-region trail.


### Manual
If you can't install the Forwarder using the provided CloudFormation template, you can install the Forwarder manually following the steps below. Feel free to open an issue or create a pull request to let us know if there is anything we can improve to make the template work for you.

1. Create a Python 3.9 Lambda function using `nops-aws-forwarder-deployment-package-<VERSION>.zip` from the latest [releases](https://github.com/nops-io/nops-aws-forwarder/releases).
2. Save your [NOPS API key](https://app.nops.io/v3/settings?tab=API%20Key) to Lambda's environment variable `NOPS_API_KEY` or encrypted kms key as `NOPS_KMS_API_KEY`
3. Add the `s3:GetObject` permission to the Lambda execution role.
4. Configure [triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-cloudtrail-example.html).
5. If you use KMS encrypted API key, please provide the access permission for lambda role for KMS Key
